Ignore Words
============

Whenever you click the `ignore XXXX` in the context menu, the word `XXXX` will be added into the `ignored_words` list.

## Motivation

I had been using Sublime 2 for years and moved to Sublime 3 in 2013. However, ST3's spell check will never remember the words it should ignore. I have googled this problem a lot and seems that the only way to solve this problem is to manually add words in the `ignored_words` list in user settings. Therefore, I made this simple plugin to do the dirty job.

## Sublime Versions

Only ST3 under linux and windows is tested. I hope it will work also for OSX users.
